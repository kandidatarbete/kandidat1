## Clock.tcl 
## CarMaker 3.0 ScriptControl Example - IPG Automotive GmbH (www.ipg.de)
##
## An example showing how to create and use a clock. 
## The clock functions work using the simulation time T and are only
## relevant when a simulation is running. When no simulation is running, 
## the clock functions will not give predictable results. 
## The functions are:
##
## ClockCreate <clock_name> <condition>
##     <clock_name> is a user specified clock name.
##     <condition>  is a boolean condition. All variable used 
##                  must have global scope. 
##     ClockCreate creates the clock.
##  
## ClockStart <clock_name>
##     ClockStart starts the clock.
##     <clock_name> is the name used in ClockCreate
##  
## ClockStop  <clock_name>
##     ClockStop stops the clock.
##     <clock_name> is the name used in ClockCreate 
##  
## ClockGetTime <clock_name>
##     ClockGetTime returns the elapsed clock time. The time can be 
##     read any time after ClockStart is called. 
##     <clock_name> is the name used in ClockCreate
##  
## ClockReset <clock_name>
##     ClockReset resets the clock without stopping it.
##     <clock_name> is the name used in ClockCreate
